# Cloaks+ Diagnostic - A tool for troubleshooting Cloaks+
Cloaks+ Diagnostic is an unofficial tool which can help you figure out what's wrong with your Cloaks+ installation.

## Setup
1. Download the release that matches your operating system in [releases](https://github.com/SeizureSaladd/CloaksDiagnostic/releases)
2. Run the tool and see what's wrong!
3. Fix the issues accordingly (a staff member will probably help you with this if you can't figure it out yourself).
